# RISC-V Debug Transport Module (DTM)

**:construction: WORK-IN-PROGRESS :construction:**

This project implements a JTAG-base *debug transport module* (DTM) for the RISC-V on-chip debugger.
The module is compatible to the official [RISC-V debug specification](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-debug-spec)
and can be used with the [RISC-V port of openOCD](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-openocd). Prebuilt binaries of the openOCD port
can be obtained from [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com/software).
